		<p><h1>The Mandalorian</h1>Is an American space Western television series created by<br>
		<span style="fontstyle:italic;fontweight:bold'>Jon Favreau for the streaming service Disney+.</span><br>
		It is the first live-action series in the Star Wars franchise, beginning five years after the events of Return of the Jedi (1983).<br>
		It stars <span style="fontstyle:italic;fontweight:bold'>Pedro Pascal</span> as the title character, a lone bounty hunter who goes on the run after being hired to retrieve "The Child".<br>
		Star Wars creator <span style="fontstyle:italic;fontweight:bold'>George Lucas</span> had begun developing a live-action Star Wars television series by 2009, but this project was deemed too expensive to produce.<br>
		He sold Lucasfilm to Disney in October 2012. Subsequently, work on a new Star Wars series began for Disney+.<br>
		Favreau signed on in March 2018, serving as writer and showrunner. He executive produces alongside <span style="fontstyle:italic;fontweight:bold'>Dave Filoni, Kathleen Kennedy, and Colin Wilson.</span><br>
		The series' title was announced in October 2018, with filming starting at Manhattan Beach Studios in California. Visual effects company Industrial Light & Magic<br>
		developed the StageCraft technology for the series, using virtual sets and a 360-degree video wall to create the series' environments. This has since been adopted by other film and television productions.<br>
		The Mandalorian premiered with the launch of Disney+ on November 12, 2019. The eight-episode first season was met with positive reviews, was nominated for Outstanding Drama Series at the 72nd Primetime Emmy Awards,<br>
		and won seven Primetime Creative Arts Emmy Awards. A second season premiered on October 30, 2020, and a third season is in pre-production. Several spin-off series will expand on the series' timeline,<br>
		including The Book of Boba Fett and Ahsoka.</p>
