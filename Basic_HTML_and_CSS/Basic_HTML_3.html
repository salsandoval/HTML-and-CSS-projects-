		<h2>Jarritos is made with grade A ingredients and the flavors are out of this world!</h2>
		<p>If you’re the person in your household who’s largely responsible for grocery shopping, 
		there’s little doubt you’ve seen them — clear glass bottles filled with liquid refreshment in eye-catching, mouth-watering shades of orange, green, yellow and red. 
		Chances are you’ve tried one as well, and maybe even a flavor (Guava? Mango? Jamaica?) you never imagined would make sense in soda form. 
		Either way, you’ve encountered a brand that has carved out more than a niche in the crowded soda marketplace, and whose appeal cuts across traditional demographic categories: Jarritos.

        But how did Jarritos come to be such a familiar sight in North American supermarkets?  
		From the beverage’s humble beginnings in a Mexican cocina to its current status as something of a household name, 
		the story of Jarritos is every bit as colorful as their naturally flavored sodas and distinctively molded glass bottles.</p>
